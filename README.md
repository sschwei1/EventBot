# DiscordEventBot
The idea behind this project is, to have a simple tool to plan on different events.
Me and a few friends often had the problem, that we never knew who would come to meetup and who still needed more information
What this bot should be capable of:

 - Create events
 - Manage information of an event (like location and time)
 - Subscribe/Unsubscribe to an event, to start/stop receiving information about it
 - Notification when a new event is created, to inform everyone about it
 
Each event will have its own channel, where only subscribed people will have access to.
